This directory will contain large **real world** TOML samples
taken from open source projects in the wild.

The objective is to create a real world use case benchmark
Instead of of relying on artificial micro benchmarks that may not be representative
of real world performance.

When adding new samples:

- Ensure they are licensed under a permissive OSS license (MIT/Apache preferred).
- Copy relevant LICENSE/Notice file to the new sub-directory.
- Create a README.md in new sub-directory with references and details to the original sources.
  - See existing samples for a template.
