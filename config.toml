description = [
  "I am originally from Spain and have called Brighton my home for 14 years. Recently, I have moved to Limerick, where I currently reside. My passion for technology and innovation led me to pursue a Bachelor degree in Electronic Engineering in 2015. After completing my degree, I had the privilege of working as a research technician at two highly respected research labs, the former [Interact Lab](https://twitter.com/labinteract) and [SCHI lab](https://multi-sensory.info/), which have now been consolidated into [the Multi-Sensory Devices (MSD)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-groups/multi-sensory-devices) group at UCL. As a research technician, I was responsible for maintaining the labs and providing hardware and software support to the researchers on the team. My work at the lab drew me in and I ended up collaborating on various papers and projects, which led me to pursue a PhD with Diego Martinez Plasencia, where I explored haptic controllers for VR and developed an open-source framework for modeling force feedback devices." , "As a multidisciplinary maker, I have experience in digital fabrication, embedded systems, VR, 3D modeling, and electronics, among other things. My research interests lie in multisensory technology, ephemeral displays, and novel displays such as smoke or bubbles. I have collaborated on multiple artistic and research projects over the last year, using my knowledge to create engaging and interactive art.","Over the past 4 years, I have collaborated with various artists, which led to the creation of Bubaki Design, a creative studio I founded in partnership with [Catherine Ireton](http://www.catherineireton.com/), a musician, site-specific artist and theatre maker. We interest is in creating experiences that leave people with a sense of wonder and awe. My PhD in VR and haptic technology, combined with my experience as a multidisciplinary maker, have given me the skills and knowledge to create cutting-edge interactive art that pushes the boundaries of what is possible. Now that I am finishing my PhD, I am excited to bring my knowledge and expertise to the field of interactive art and continue exploring the intersection of technology and art."

This solution introduces quantal meta-surfaces, using pre-made 3D units called metamaterial bricks for phase delay encoding. By assembling these bricks, meta-surfaces can produce any diffraction-limited acoustic field, leading to acoustic focusing, steering and levitation.
